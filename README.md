# GuideMe

Have you ever thought it would be nice to book your guide before you visit somewhere you have never been before and tell him/her what places you wish to visit?

You are in the right spot!

GuideMe is a Ruby on Rails application built in eight days for travelers who would like to find a guide in a specific city. It's meant for an easy way for travelers to book a guide and communicate with them instantly. My role in this project was a full stack developer. We've implemented various API's including Google Maps, Stripe, Yelp, and PixaBay.

You can check out the live version [here] (https://guideme-2016.herokuapp.com/).
